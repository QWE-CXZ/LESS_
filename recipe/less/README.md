# Beyond High-Entropy Exploration: Correctness-Aware Low-Entropy Segment-Based Advantage Shaping for Reasoning LLMs



## 🔍 Project Overview

This project proposes **LESS (Low-Entropy Segment Shaping)**, a correctness-aware reinforcement learning framework for reasoning LLMs. Unlike existing entropy-based methods that only focus on high-entropy exploration tokens, LESS explicitly leverages low-entropy segments—stable structural components that account for ~80% of reasoning trajectories—to optimize policy updates.

By distinguishing low-entropy segments into "correct-only", "incorrect-only", and "shared" types, LESS amplifies productive reasoning patterns, suppresses repeated errors, and preserves high-entropy exploration. Instantiated on top of GRPO, it consistently improves accuracy, stability, and robustness across mathematical reasoning tasks.

## 🚀 Core Features

- **Low-Entropy Segment Awareness**: Identifies and modulates stable reasoning structures based on their correlation with correctness.

- **Plug-and-Play Design**: Seamlessly integrates with existing RLVR algorithms (e.g., GRPO) as an advantage-shaping module.

- **Performance Boost**: Outperforms strong baselines (GRPO, Forking Tokens, KL-Cov) on 6+ math benchmarks.

- **Robustness Enhancement**: Reduces worst-case performance variance and raises the floor of model reliability.

- **Broad Compatibility**: Works with diverse model scales (1.5B–7B) and both math-specialized/base LLMs.

## 📊 Key Results

- **Accuracy Improvement**: Average accuracy gains of 2–4 points across Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B, and Qwen2.5-Base-7B.

- **Challenging Tasks**: Notable gains on AIME24/25 (math olympiad-level tasks) and AMC23.

- **Worst-Case Robustness**: Improves `worst@32` score by +6.1 (1.5B) and +7.8 (7B) points compared to vanilla GRPO.

- **Stability**: Reduces response variance (std@32) across sampled rollouts for more predictable reasoning.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Dependencies: Follow [verl](https://github.com/volcengine/verl) installation guide (supports PyTorch, FSDP, Megatron-LM).

- Inference Engine: [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) ≥ 0.8.2 (for high-throughput rollout generation).

- Model: [Qwen2.5 family](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5) (1.5B/7B Math, 7B Base; other LLMs compatible with modification).

### Quick Run

For training Qwen2.5-7B on a single node (8 NVIDIA A100-40G GPUs):

```bash

cd verl
conda activate your_env
bash 7b_base.sh
